0,Kia Seltos,"I brought seltos htx one week back.This is my 6 th car following innova crysta,xuv500,duster,Honda city and1dzire.I can safely say that this is best overall car in this price range at present. Seltos is near perfect vehicle by many angles. It's design is fantastic,looks are fantastic,features are fantastic, refinement is excellent,NVH levels are superb,ride quality is superb and easily comparable to my innova crysta, diesel manual mileage is excellent,seat comfort is superb.Back seat of this vehicle occupies 3 people comfortably. Boot space has enough space for luggage of five people for a short trip.I drove this vehicle on really ugly Bhokar-Nanded road of maharashtra(bad is very mild word for this road at present,i think ,and I can assure you that ,this vehicle has one of the best ride quality which can be easily comparable to my innova crysta in terms of ride quality. Seltos is breeze to drive.I drove petrol GT line also for short distance,and it is also a great variant to own.You can go for either variants as per your needs and choice.Both variants are great. Diesel is giving me 17 kmpl overall at present for 60% highway and 40% city drive with AC 100% on. I hope,Mileage will definitely increase after second service(oil change to 19 Kmpl overall. Smart air purifier with perfume diffuser is a added advantage.AC is powerful and works fantastically.In my opinion,At present,there is no competitor for seltos,when it comes to overall package. So friends,who are in two minds,JUST GO FOR THIS VEHICLE BLINDLY. YOU CAN PURCHASE ANY VARIANT DEPENDING UPON YOUR NEEDS,AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT,MOST OF YOU WILL BE VERY PLEASED TO OWN THIS VEHICLE.",16 Sep 2019,www.zigwheels.com,5.0

0,MG Hector,"I booked MG Hector on 19th of July, 2019. I opted for the Smart DCT option (Aurora Silver at MG’s Showroom Ahmedabad which is owned by Concept motors. I had driven MG before booking the car itself. But after booking it I still wanted a test drive. So 2 weeks after booking the car i went down for a test drive. I was with the same sales person who sold me the car. I was just cruising around on the service road when there was a thud noise in the Engine and then the car stopped. I looked on to the information cluster ahead and it showed orange coloured exclamation mark to which the sales person told that there is some issue with the transmission of the car. He called some guy from the technical dept where he told me that transmission had failed and it was the second time something like this happened. The car had only 4200km on the test runs. I cancelled the booking the next day to which their manager told me to wait and let’s see if there was any issue or not. But as I was adamant they proceeded with the refund. Though they told me that the refund will be processed within 15 days, it took them 28 days just to process it and give me the cheque that too after alot of follow ups. The car is good on cosmetics but I don’t think so that you can trust the engine in long run. MG still needs to take care and refine the engine according to indian road conditions. Giving variety of features won’t help if there is an issue in the Engine Quality.",9 Sep 2019,www.zigwheels.com,1.0
1,MG Hector,"brilliant car by Mg . If we compare the cars in hectors price range Jeep compass is over prized no premium features no comfort. Tata Harrier is fair and interior is worst . The segment king Hyundai Creta is just like I20 wearing heels it is not a car Worth buying.

0,Jeep Compass,On our first trip we averaged 30+ miles to the gallon.  The only reason I gave it one less star on the comfort is my last car was an Escalade.  Hard to compare.

3,Jeep Compass,"Everything is great except for one thing. We dislike the stop/start feature. It does not save gas like they say it does and the fact it has to be hard on the engine and the starter and the fact if the system fail to start back up , it may leave a family stuck in a dangerous traffic situationI was not use to it and gave it too much acceleration and nearly rear ended the car in front of me This device is a big joke.","                by Campman1965                from Bethel , Pa.                on Sat Jan 12 2019",www.cars.com,5
4,Jeep Compass,Great car for the money. It’s very quiet at 70mph. rides very good lot better than a wrangler. The cabin is surprisingly roomy. trunk not near as big as a Tahoe but it’s got enuff room for groceries or a couple of suitcases. Running 65 or 70 I’ll get 31 or 32 mpg in the city easing around I’ll get 27 or 28. Well that was the good time for the bad. Um the biggest thing I wished it had was about 50 more horsepower. I got the 6speed manual because the 9 speed is awful it changes constantly it’s never in the right gear and if you need to get out of the way quickly in case of a emergency say prayer you will have time. What I’m mean by that is if you are running 55 and you are wanting to pass some one make sure you plenty of room because from the time you press down on the gas pedal it will take the automatic 15 sec to find the right gear. One thing I don’t like is every model except the trail hawk comes with a plastic guard that hangs way below the bumper and it drags stuff very easily that need to be deleted at least for 4x4s. The last two things I dislike or would change if could is just nit picking stuff. Little bit lower first gear on the 6speed manual. Last is when you engage the 4x4 there’s also a 4x4 lock button but it doesn’t lock all 4 wheels in. It has the equipment to put power to all 4 wheels at once but the computer want let it. Ok that long I know just wanted to be specific. Conclusion for me was positives out weight the negatives by a lot. There is other SUV’s I’d rather have but there 45to 55k. To me this is the best 4x4 in this size for the money. I payed 22000 for mine now days you are not going to get a lot for that.

5,Jeep Compass,"I traded my worn out 2003 GMC Envoy for a 2018 preowned Compass Latitude package plus some add on Limited extras.  I could not be more pleased with the comfort, styling and performance of this vehicle.   This is my ""retirement"" vehicle so staying within a fixed income budget was a priority.   Some complain the 4 cylinder engine isn't responsive but it has plenty of zip and acceleration as far as I'm concerned.  Along with the 8.4 inch display, rear camera, UConnect, lane sensing, etc., the electronics package is a pure joy.   The car had 18K on it which didn't bother me at all.  I'll drive it for another 120K if not more.  Truth be told, I originally had my heart set on a Renegade but after a test drive the suspension was just a little more bumpy than I could handle.  The next step up was a Compass which I had never really considered.  After the test drive I was sold.  It came home with me the next day.   Sure, you always want more but it also comes with a price tag.  I would have loved heated seats,  sitting up a bit higher on the frame,  power passenger seat but then you need to start looking in the 30-40K range to get into a preowned Terrain, Explorer, etc.  I landed this for 22K.  Did I mention this vehicle had the dual section sun/moon roof  I'm a star gazer so I could not resist :-","                by Kansas 2018 Jeep Compass Fan                from Manhattan, KS                on Thu Dec 06 2018",www.cars.com,5
6,Jeep Compass,"Now that I have 6k miles on my Compass I feel safe to say.I LOVE IT! I live in an area with 4 seasons and when we were covered with 6-10 inches of snow I had NO PROBLEMS getting around with the 4x4 snow option. I love the convenience of an SUV and the fuel economy of a full size car. I got the limited with all the features and it just made me fall even more in love with it. The 8"" display is beautiful. Paired with Android Auto it makes the navigation display on the screen so easy to see and follow. The leather heated seats AUTOMATICALLY turn on when the temp is below freezing with remote start! So when I get in my Jeep I'm nice and toasty. The power lift gate is so convenient when trying to load groceries in a hurry if it is cold or raining. I hit the lift gate button when I exit the store and it's open and ready for me to toss it all in, then push a button and it closes by itself. This is so great when your car is covered in salt from the treated roads and you don't have to get it all over you! The little things matter You appreciate it when you're in those moments. I have 2 kids and my fiance and I like to golf We have no issues with the available space. The seats fold down if we need some extra room for the clubs. The panoramic sun roof is beautiful The day I bought it we were headed for the beach and it was so great being able to practically open the entire roof and let the sun shine on in. I get compliments daily on the style. I have the upgraded rims and the limited trim and everyone comments on how stylish it is. It stands out from the base model compass that's for sure. In summary, you'll love this Jeep. The limited may be a little pricey compared to the base model but you won't be disappointed in the purchase. All the extras really make this the most enjoyable vehicle I've ever owned.

8,Jeep Compass,"My 2018 Jeep Compass Limited left me stranded twice. Both times it would not start. They were unable to find the problem. Two trips to the dealer. First time it had a little over 200 miles on it second time 3,500 miles on it. Battery is good, charges, mechanic thinks there is something that is causing the battery to lose charge, but, is unable to figure it out. I am now involved with FCA Customer Care . Hoping for a fix to the car,as, it is fun to drive when it works. Comfortable for me , fun panoramic sunroof, and a nice radio. Though being worried every time I go to start it , is not a nice way to feel. This is a safety issue. I would not buy this car againToo many hassles with the car and aspects of having to work with FCA. I am very happy to read of all the people that are loving their cars.

9,Jeep Compass,"This is the second Jeep (and only the second car I've owned. I ran my first Jeep (an '02 Liberty, for 11 years and she's still going out there somewhere. I decided to stick with Jeep, but needed something better on gas and even better reliability since I commute in and out of the city. So I went with the '18 Jeep Compass. I've had it for going on 4 months now and so far I have zero complaints. It's a slick design inside and out. Smooth ride, good on gas, roomy, feels safe, great limited package. The ONLY thing I don't like so far is the automatic engine shut-off. I, at this point, habitually just turn it off manually before I go anywhere. It's more of a pain than anything. Based off of other reviews, I'm not too concerned with its performance in snow. My Liberty was typically fine with it, I'm sure the Compass will be just fine.","                by caseyd                from Washington, DC                on Wed Jun 26 2019",www.cars.com,5

I got the 2018 FWD limited with the tech packageSluggish acceleration and the engine sounds like crap when you push it, good luck passing anyone. Inside is roomy and comfy  and looks great, love the huge moon roof. Also no longer comes with a spare tire, only an air compressor when the spare should be. Uconect crashes at the most inopportune times and when it does work is often slow to respond when you tap the touch screen, XM radio signal not so great. Back up camera entirey too bright, HATE the Eco option, makes me feel like I'm stalling out and then when it fired back up there is a delay that makes stop signs and turning dangerous when you need to be quick. Also if you open the door to back up close to something the Ebrake automatically turns on, you can turn it off after the fact but it's old after only a week.Perfect as far as size goes, bigger than a Renegade but smaller than the Grand Cherokee. Condensation build up in the headlights 2nd day after purchase. Dealer looking at it today, going to ask if I can upgrade to the Grand Cherokee.

16,Jeep Compass,"Overall I’m very pleased with the Jeep.  Very comfortable ride.  The narrow wheelbase is an issue on icy roads with above average winds.  I haven’t come close to the “expected” fuel mileage.  It has great ground clearance and I put it through the paces in heavy snow. Didn’t ever feel like I might get stuck.  Honestly- I was impressed.  Handled nicely.  Small pet leave.  It’s hard to fully clean the back window with the overhang.  Big pet peeve.  If your going to put auto start in a vehicle, put one in that works.  I shouldn’t have to be line of sight and within arms reach for it to work.  Seriously $30,000 and I had to go buy an Astro start.  What joke.

33,Jeep Compass,"This is the second Jeep I've owned.  I had a Cherokee in '98.  The Compass is a manual transmission which is so much fun.  Even though it's a little 4cyl, it's got pep.  Inside space is roomy.  Cargo space is pretty good, too, when I put the back seats down.  I love the new body style, looks like a baby Grand Cherokee, but WAY better MPG!!!

37,Jeep Compass,"I'm writing this review because all of them I read seem to be on the new Compass.  We bought ours new in 2013.  It's a 2014.  I can't imagine a more reliable, more useful vehicle.  You could say it's my wife's car, but I do drive it from time to time.  I'm 6'2"" tall.  The thing I noticed most the first time I got in it was the head room I had.  I have more in the Compass than I have in my 2018 Chevy Silverado.  Simply put, after 5 years and about 35,000 miles, we have zero complaints.  I've been urging her to go get another new one, but she likes this one too much to turn loose of it.

39,Jeep Compass,"This car is great, fast and sleek. Its winter in Alaska so I use the snow mode all the time. Super steady on the road and feels great. Looks great, like the Grand Cherokee at half the cost, although the Cherokee is getting a makeover for 2019 too.Pros: Great driver, heated steering wheel and seats are a plus, and I love that they turn on automatically with the autostart (when its cold. Four doors, good headroom in the back even for a tall person. Storage in the rear fits two full side suitcases side by side. Electronic steering is  very smooth and easy. Some poeple might mention the engine being weak and it is anything but. I have the 2.4, and it has plenty of power. I dont know why someone needs to jump from 60 to 70 like a spring, but this can do that too. Its a smart transmission, very smooth and quiet. As much power as you will ever need, and then some.Cons: Cant get the seat into the perfect comfort spot. Doesnt have lumbar and it feels like it was just made for a smaller person. I'm 6'7"" so I didnt expect much. The headrest hits me in the back weird sometimes. The center armrest is also very firm. On a long drive, my elbow gets pretty sore. With the front seats moved back a lil, not much legroom in the back, even if there is headroom.Overall, great car at a great price. The Cherokee is maybe a little bigger for the same price, but I m not a fan of the current front end, next years model will be nice though. This is a mix of the great look, a great engine, and a new, sporty, all wheel drive, winter daily driver.","                by Rogue Jeep                from Seward, Ak                on Thu Jan 11 2018",www.cars.com,5

41,Jeep Compass,"I have not had the Compass very long, so I honestly cannot speak to its reliability. In all other areas, it hits the mark. The interior is comfortable and the Latitude trim, with popular and cold weather groups, is well appointed with creature comforts. I have never owned a vehicle with a heated steering wheel, but I will from now on. I am a former Jeep Wrangler owner, the compass is not in any way, the off road beast the Wrangler was. So, if your goal is the same off road ability with an upgrade in comfort, don't buy the Compass. If you are looking for pointed style, comfort and technology while being able to get to work in the middle of a Noreaster, the Compass should be on your test drive list.About the issue of powerno, the Compass will not win many points, but we also own a '17 Equinox 4cyl. and the Compass is superior. It handles like a tight and smooth European sedan that allows the driver to feel confident under harsh conditions. I have owned several Honda Pilots and VW sedansthe Compass competes well with the Pilot (suv giant and VW (autobahn cruiser. It has very good marks for being safeand, its fun to drive and keeps my hands warm!

42,Jeep Compass,We bought this Jeep a few days ago. We got the ski gray and black leather seats and they look and feel great. It snowed today and my wife had 0 issues getting through it with the 4 wheel drive. We traded in a 2014 Cherokee and my wife while she really liked the Cherokee loves the Compass and is glad we bought it.  Everyone that has seen it loves the way it looks and the stylish interior. Also people are saying the engine and transmission are sluggish. We find it to be very smooth and for a 4 cylinder engine it actually picks up speed very well and is not sluggish at all.,                by upsmanchris                from MN                on Fri Dec 29 2017,www.cars.com,5
43,Jeep Compass,I moved from Florida to Denver Colorado. I had a FWD car that I put snow tires on and it didn't OK until a blizzard. I knew from that point on I wanted a 4 wheel drive but I couldn't find one I liked. Then I saw the Jeep compass. Colorado is known Jeep country because they do so well in the snow. I test drove it and bought it the same day. I have a limited and this thing is loaded. It has not disappointed in the snow and I only have all seasonal tires. This is not slow but it will not win any races but it is not a race horse but a work horse. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.,                by Jeepluvr                from Denver                on Thu Mar 15 2018,www.cars.com,5
44,Jeep Compass,"I've owned the 2018 Jeep Compass Limited for a little over 3 weeks now and I have to say it is a fantastic car. Some background before I jump into the pros and cons. I primarily use this vehicle for commuting, but will occasionally bring it on trails/off road.  I've seen a few reviews on the new compass which I felt were a little extreme and not too accurate. If you want a basic, un-bias review continue reading.Pros:Exterior re-design - This is a sharp car. In the 3 weeks I've owned it I've received many compliments on the look. The face lift of the Compass is extremely similar to the Grand Cherokee and at a quick glance looks like an Evoque with it's two tone color format. There are a few LED light upgrades which give the car a more luxury prescience.Interior: Keep in mind this is in the small suv class, but the car is comfortable with a surprising amount of room for backseat passengers. The seats and trim also feel sturdy and well made. Not to mentioned the U-Connect system allows you to customize the lights, display themes etc. to make the interior customized to your liking. Most trims also have Apple Car Play. My trim came with a pano sunroof which is a very cool feature. Roof is all glass which passengers enjoy.Drive Comfort: This car isn't going to blow you away with performance. However, if you're simply looking for a car to get you from A to B with a little pep in it's step when needed, this car does just fine. I've driven it on highways, city streets, backroads etc. and the car has a smooth feel on all terrains. This car also allows you to change the drive setting based on terrain (Auto, Snow, Sand, MudSafety: The new Compass comes with 7 airbags standard. I decided to purchase the safety package which comes with lane assist, blind spot monitoring and forward collision warning. Cons:Engine Shut Off: First time owning a car with this feature and I'm not a huge fan. Essentially when you come to a stop light and are idle for more than 5 seconds the car will shut off the engine until you take your foot off the brake. Not a big deal, and the feature CAN be turned off. Multi Air Engine Up Hill: At first acceleration up hill the multi air engine tends to rev a little higher than I'd like. Again,not a big deal but trying to point out a few things as a heads up.Overall, if you're looking for an attractive vehicle that gives you off road capability, comfortable ride, decent performance, high tech interior with essentially any upgrade option you could think of this is a great car. If you're looking for a powerful suv with better towing capacity, spend the extra money and buy the Grand Cherokee. 9.5/10 for me.",                by NJ1                on Mon Sep 18 2017,www.cars.com,5
45,Jeep Compass,"The first thing you will see on every review when researching this car is the ""lack of power"". Coming from a 3.8 L JK Wrangler, I do not think it is that bad. Yes you will start thinking twice on the highway before over taking that truck, but it still gets the job done. I can't imagine it's any worse than the Cherokee with the same engine Look and feel of the inside is great. My only complaint is that there is a bit of rattle and creaking that occurs on bumpy roads and with music.  A couple other bugs,  like Uconnect crashing, and the door not consistently unlocking when I exit the car.  Just some small bugs that need to be worked out on this first year of a new model. Overall I hope these are just small bugs in the first batch.  Basic sound system is surprisingly good. ESS (start-stop system needs to be turned off every time you turn on the car if you don't like it. However, I was annoyed by that only for the drive home from the dealership. Now I sort of like it. You quickly get use to it, moving your foot from the brake to gas a split of a second slower. Also, gentle pressure on the brake at a stop sign will avoid activation of the ESS. Now I barely think about it. I get about 24 MPG with 50/50 city and highway driving. I would get it again. It gets 4/5 stars just because of the handful of bugs I will have to deal with. If it weren't for those, 5/5 for sure.",                by Kuba                on Fri Jul 14 2017,www.cars.com,5
46,Jeep Compass,"I am a safe driver so the reports that the Compass is slow means nothing to me. It’s a 4 cylinder vehicle if you want to go fast get the Grand Cherokee SRT. So far I am very happy with my Compass. I am a long time Jeep owner(my wife has a 15’ Grand Cherokee altitude. I currently have 1,500 miles and everything performs great. Tested this Compass in the snow and it was great. I have the Limited which is fully equipped. The uconnect is great and I love using Apple Car play. Bottom line the 2018 Compass is a great 4*4 smaller SUV. If you are looking to go 0-60 in 3 seconds this vehicle is not for you but if you want an all around good vehicle look into the Compass.",                by FrankT                from Mineola NY                on Sat Apr 07 2018,www.cars.com,5
47,Jeep Compass,"After my first 1000 miles, I like the features and comfortable ride.  Compared to other small SUV's I test drove, features like remote start and a very nice sounding stereo without having to pay top-of-the-line pricing is a great deal.  The acceleration is good enough for getting around town and merging into traffic.  My only complaints are the quirky controls for the uConnect entertainment system and the front seat cup-holders need to be located for a forward reach rather than an arm-twisting side reach.  My previous car had the start/stop engine feature, so that doesn't bother me, and it saves gas.",                by Nyce Ryd                from Upstate NY                on Thu Nov 16 2017,www.cars.com,5
48,Jeep Compass,"I bought a new vehicle because I am a travel nurse and I was about to drive to California. After arriving on the west coast, I seriously cannot stop talking about how great the drive way. There was rain, mountains, flat areas, heat, wind and so much more I faced and I felt safe the entire time! I love the blind spot sensors, especially in California when motorcycles drive between cars. The extra large sunroof makes the drive during the day, and night, that much better. The Beats by Dre speakers are something I always show off. The navigation gets me everywhere I need to go, which is perfect when I live in a brand new state.

Living in a cold weather state, I really wanted a vehicle that had a remote starter as well as All Wheel Drive.  The review that really sold me was that for the price, it was the best off roading and weather handling car out there.  Gas mileage could be better and it is not the quickest to 60 mph, but as an everyday car and one that can be used for some adventure it is great.  The sound system is an added bonus.  I also was a fan of the body style as now it looks like a mini Grand Cherokee.  The cold weather package with heated seats and steering wheel is wonderful with the remote start.

58,Jeep Compass,I like the vehicle overall so far . There are two things that Jeep could improve on better gas mileage when the AC is one. Because it eats gas for breakfast and also the start and stop feature to conserve gas really makes it use more gas.

69,Jeep Compass,"My pleasure with this car did not last too long even when it gets back on the road again, today is in dealer again towed in this time.  There is at least one problem that has never been cleared up first shop stay for 11 days 2nd day so far for this time.  They could not seem to get parts and or understand what work was needed last time. In about a year I have had this car I have never felt it was not without problems.

70,Jeep Compass,This car is awesome and I get so many compliments. My only negative is that after 15 min the car is warmed up from a drive the idling is really loud. Its sounds like a loud fan or rngine mot sure. This is a 2018 it should not be doing this.,"                by Nay518                from Bronx, New York                on Fri Aug 10 2018",www.cars.com,5
71,Jeep Compass,"I have owned a 2017 Compass and a 2018 Compass with similar options.  The 2018 is much improved from my 2017.  It looks a lot nicer, and drives nicer.  I love the overall design and the subtle changes they have made, like moving the rear door handles, and removing the cup holder from the floor in the back seat.","                by xlate011370                from Cleveland, OH                on Wed Dec 06 2017",www.cars.com,5

73,Jeep Compass,"I love the way it drives. It feels like a sport car, it is very responsive to the way I handle it. It has several features I've never had before like a large screen that shows me when I am backing up. I can download maps for directions. It has 4 wheel drive and I have never owned a 4 wheel drive before. I love the power seat buttons and the steering wheel that adjusts up and down to give me the best fit. I love the color. It is the closest color to my purple I was looking for. It is called Jazz Blue and it almost looks purple when you look one way and it is a deep blue when you look the other way. It has everything I wanted except Onstar. But I have remedied that.",                by Sandra Pleased owner                from Spokane                on Sat Aug 25 2018,www.cars.com,5
74,Jeep Compass,"This is the second Jeep Compass I've owned. I really loved my 2014 Compass, but decided to trade up to the new 2018 because of all of its new features. I love the touch screen, the backup camera and the U-connect features. There is one new feature I'm not crazy about that I just need to get used to. The Electronic Stop/Start turns the engine off momentarily while the vehicle is stopped at a traffic signal or in long lines of stop and go traffic. It restarts instantly when your foot is removed from the brake. It was a little disconcerting at first, but in long run it supposed to save on gas. The 2.4-liter engine is much peppier than the engine in my 2014 Compass. On interstates, acceleration and passing is nearly effortless. One other minor drawback is that the cargo area seems to be a little smaller than what I had before. And the tie downs in the cargo area have been moved and there's not as many of them. I use these for hauling multiple 5-gal. gas cans when needed. But overall, this is a well designed, comfortable automobile. No substantive complaints at all.","                by Dave W                from Palatka, FL                on Sat Oct 20 2018",www.cars.com,5

Was pretty reliable and was ok in the snow.  My lease was up last month and I went to look at the new 2018 Jeep Compass and I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS THE SAME VEHICLE!!!!

122,Jeep Compass,"Test drive this car. Loved the look of it. Didn’t feel sluggish at all, despite being 4 cylinders.My 3 issues are that the steering wheel feels and sounds rough/papery. It actually makes a sound under your hands while turning- like rough paper. That may be something that would resolve/smooth out over time It was very distracting during the test drive.Second issue is storage/cargo space not sure I could fit my daughters large Dance bag in the cargo area without having to fold down the rear seats, and then we wouldn’t all fit in the car.Third issue is also size-related. Feels much smaller than comparable vehicles in the rear. And rear seats are very close to the front seats.

I happened to meet one handsome gentleman named Jerry and his kind manager & colleagues, they help me choose the vehicle, reminder me every details for purchasing a new car and keep on concerning my using it even though I finish the deal. I bought that car in redline pearl this October and now I could drive to school, libraries and stores when I need. It gives me a new horizon I never experience before. Now I begin to love Winnipeg and treat my Compass as a girl baby: she depends on me and sometimes if I ignore her a little, she usually shows her unhappiness. At this time, I just return to spoil her a bit, for example, having a bath for her, she smiles again. We love each other. Hope others' friends own the same amazing feeling as I have.

143,Jeep Compass,Its a good value for the pricing. AWD SUV under $25k in most cases but you get what you pay for. The seats are extremely uncomfortable due to design. The bucket leans back too far and the head rest stick too far forward placing the spine at an awkward angle. There is no room for a standard infant car seat in the cabin unless both front riders move seats essentially into the dashboard. thus an uncomfortable ride when going long distances. Im not particularly a fan of the auto off feature to save gas on this gas guzzler. I need to refill every 4 days to cover the same distance I drove in my much larger Tuscon which didn't need filling until every 8-10 days.  The exterior design is quite sleek and comparable to the Grand Cherokee at a fraction of the price. Some models have cargo mats that change the sleek look. The Uconnect app is not available for many 2018 which sucks for remote start during the colder days.,                by sonais7                from Philadelphia                on Tue Apr 03 2018,www.cars.com,5

152,Jeep Compass,"I was given one of these as a rental while my care was in the shop after an accident.  As a bigger man, this was the largest vehicle that they had to offer on the lot so there was not a lot of choices. The first thing that I noticed was the problem of just getting in and out of the vehicle. (I am a 2 car family I own a Ford focus and my husband a Chevy Equinox. I have no problem getting in and out of my Ford, but the Compass No matter what, when my butt was in the seat, I could not tilt my head far enough to get in the Compass with any ease. I drive 50 miles between work and home and that is when my problems with the compass began. The rental place was kind enough to fill the tank before I left, but just as I came home I noticed the dip in the gas gauge (not a good sign folks. The main issue that I took umbrage with was the stop/start feature. To me this is the dumbest most idiotic thing to put on a gas guzzler. I have about 7 stop lights and 4 stop signs that I have to get trough just to get to work. For those who say that this feature saves gas you are an idiot, PERIOD. the wear on the battery and starter alone negates the savings in fuel economy. (Yes, I am aware that they beefed up the starter and the battery to compensate for the start/stop feature.  After 1 trip from the rental place to home and then one to work and one back home the compass was below a 1/2 of a tank. The Equinox it would take me a week and 3 days to reach a 1/2 of a tank. The Ford 2 weeks.  The seats were uncomfortable as I felt like my rear end was hanging in the air while my butt cheeks were being poked by the seat edges. I felt like i was setting on a cardboard box that could support my weight. No matter how I adjusted, inflated, moved, raised the seat, it still felt like only the bare edge of my can were being supported. Now let's get to my issue with the infotainment unit. Looks nice till you have to use it. Why is the seat controls in a different section than the climate controls The other thing is there is only 2 settings low and holy xxxx that is hot. Unfortunately, the heated steering wheel gets extremely too hot. The entire ergonomics of this SUV are horrible, the stereo controls are on the back side of the steering wheel is just bad placement. To operate them please hold your arms at 3 and 9 did I mention that the arm rest is about 4 inches below your elbow Welcome to the Detroit lean club! As it turns out my brother owns an older Compass, When I told him of my issues with it, I was given the retort of ""It's a Jeep thing"" I replied that this is actually the 3rd Jeep that I have had to drive, I can honestly tell you that trough study and experience, and you are  dumb as xxxx. Yes I figured out the start/stop feature can be turned off, which I promptly turned off. Guess what the gas mileage improved but not enough to even recommend this SUV, go with a Honda, or a Toyota, xxxx, go with a horse, it would be better than the 2018 Jeep Compass.",                by Michael                from Rocky Mount                on Sat Dec 29 2018,www.cars.com,5
153,Jeep Compass,"Lots of electronics & gadgets come standard, and I will never use them. Does not come with a spare tire-that's an extra expense option.

155,Jeep Compass,"This SUV has all kinds of bells and whistles that appear to have been added as work arounds for poor design, layout and basic function.  At first blush the seating seems very low with the window sill at nearly shoulder level! Upon further examination I realized that the window is very short, the sill is high to make up for the short glass.  This creates a series of issues with side visibility.  The mirrors are oval and do not give good rear view coverage so there is a camera.  The sill height prevents the driver from seeing any pavement within 10 feet of the car's side so they have added lane detection.  Unfortunately these issues make the Jeep Compass completely unsuitable for city or off-road driving.","                by Iris Guy                from Kuna, Idaho                on Fri Jun 22 2018",www.cars.com,5

177,Jeep Compass,"Actually was in the market for a smaller SUV having owned a rogue I wanted something different. When I was renting the rental company told me to pick what ever SUV I wanted from the row they had almost all the small brand SUV's but the jeep caught my eye, if was so pretty sitting there a very impressive blue with a black top, I was in awe. Driving it I felt very comfortable.  The dash, the steering, the seats, the technology got me, I had to own this SUV. When I got home I started searching and found that compass the same color and almost the same features as the rental but, something more beautiful caught my eye. There she was sitting out of view a silver one with the Black top almost like the one pictured minus the silver and black hood.  She had black rims, black jeep lettering, the silver body, and black top, I was in love. When I opened her up the Black leather interior and most of the comfort features as my rental got me. She was mine, she took me in for a joy ride and from there I couldn't let her go. I took her home that night, after the perfect deal. I just hope she remains faithful and gives me the most pleasurable rides around the curves of the roads as we dance to her beautiful music.",                by Cygnusrx                from Van nuys                on Sat Apr 21 2018,www.cars.com,5

227,Jeep Compass,"The 2018 Jeep Renegade is my first New Car, I have been an owner for about two weeks and I can truly say that I am very happy with the decision on buying one of these unique little vehicles.  At first I was skeptical as my friends with Jeeps of their own said not to buy that style Jeep as it was a model ""built to break"" or ""not a real Jeep"". After asking questions and doing tons of research, car shopping, etc. My husband and I felt confidant with making the purchase and we couldn't be happier with our decision.  As a young blossoming family with a new baby on the way, we believe this vehicle will keep up with durability, efficiency and comfort for years to come.

Driving it I felt very comfortable.  The dash, the steering, the seats, the technology got me, I had to own this SUV. When I got home I started searching and found that compass the same color and almost the same features as the rental but, something more beautiful caught my eye. There she was sitting out of view a silver one with the Black top almost like the one pictured minus the silver and black hood.  She had black rims, black jeep lettering, the silver body, and black top, I was in love. When I opened her up the Black leather interior and most of the comfort features as my rental got me.

As far as being under powered if you think the Jeep is try driving the 2018 Santa Fe I traded. Now that's under powered. So far for the money I would say this exceeds my expectations and I have not experienced any of the negatives that others reported. I would recommend the Jeep Compass to anyone.,"                by SG                from Carroll, MD                on Wed Mar 13 2019",www.cars.com,5
