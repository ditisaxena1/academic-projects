After approximately one month their team came to record video and they accepted the faulty things and they took my vehicle to dealership/ workshop for 7 days and even after that problems not resolved dashboard problems enhanced.

       "['\\nI booked MG Hector on 19th of July, 2019. I opted for the Smart DCT option (Aurora Silver) at MGâ€™s Showroom Ahmedabad which is owned by Concept motors. I had driven MG before booking the car itself. But after booking it I still wanted a test drive. So 2 weeks after booking the car i went down for a test drive. I was with the same sales person who sold me the car. I was just cruising around on the service road when there was a thud noise in the Engine and then the car stopped. I looked on to the information cluster ahead and it showed orange coloured exclamation mark to which the sales person told that there is some issue with the transmission of the car. He called some guy from the technical dept where he told me that transmission had failed and it was the second time something like this happened. The car had only 4200km on the test runs. I cancelled the booking the next day to which their manager told me to wait and letâ€™s see if there was any issue or not. But as I was adamant they proceeded with the refund. Though they told me that the refund will be processed within 15 days, it took them 28 days just to process it and give me the cheque that too after alot of follow ups. The car is good on cosmetics but I donâ€™t think so that you can trust the engine in long run. MG still needs to take care and refine the engine according to indian road conditions. Giving variety of features wonâ€™t help if there is an issue in the Engine Quality.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nbrilliant car by Mg . If we compare the cars in hectors price range Jeep compass is over prized no premium features no comfort. Tata Harrier is fair and interior is worst . The segment king Hyundai Creta is just like I20 wearing heels it is not a car Worth buying. I waited for mg was confused in hector and Creta but hector was just better than creta in terms of design, features, interior . So those people planning to buy hector buy the smart model because it worth buying and I have also bought the smart one.\\n',\n",
